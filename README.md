Data Science Portfolio - 2018 Stop and Frisk NYC 

This portfolio details data and visualisations of NYPD stop and frisk policies during the year 2018. The inspiration for this portfolio was brought forward while teaching middle school math and a need to focus on statistics, data science and incorporating anti racist pedagogy. 

A second notebook is contained in this repo that has mapped incidents of stop and frisk across NYC to their corresponding police precincts. 

The data is taken directly from the open source info avaiable from the NYPD.

There were many angles that could be taken when analysing and visualising this data, the main focus of this portfolio was uncovering information about racial disparities, age and location. 

This was my first attempt at a data science portfolio - any suggestions, constructive feedback is much appreciated.
